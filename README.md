# OnlineTests4U-An_Online_Examination_Portal
<b>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</b> This project is a web based solution for colleges, institutes and other organizations to conduct examinations which students can attempt from anywhere irrespective of their geographical locations. This product acts as an intermediate between institutes and students for conducting any kind of online examination. Institutes enter the questions they want in the exam through this web application. These questions are displayed as a test to students. The students can enter the website with their login credentials and attempt the test but only once. The answers entered by the students are then evaluated and their score is calculated, published and saved. This score then can be accessed by the institutes to determine the passing students and to evaluate their performance. This solution provides the platform but does not directly participate in, nor is it involved in any tests conducted. Questions are posted not by the site, but by the users of the site. The site requires an institute to register before posting the questions.
